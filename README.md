# TinyMVCino

**Lightweight MVC Framework for Arduino-based ESP32 Projects**

🛠️ Simplify Complex Logic · 🚀 Designed for Microcontrollers · 🧩 Event-Driven Architecture

TinyMVCino is a minimalist **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** framework for ESP32 devices running on the Arduino framework. Built for developers who need structured code without bloat, it empowers you to organize IoT projects cleanly while conserving precious RAM/Flash resources.

## Why TinyMVCino?

✅ Ultra-Light: Minimal overhead for ESP32’s constrained environments.

✅ Event-Driven: Decouple components with pub/sub-style event handling.

✅ Arduino-First: No ESP-IDF dependencies—works seamlessly with PlatformIO and Arduino IDE.

✅ Batteries Included: UART logging, task scheduling, and easy configuration.


**Build Smarter, Not Harder** ✨

TinyMVCino lets you focus on what your project does—not how to structure it. Perfect for smart home devices, sensor hubs, and IoT prototypes!
